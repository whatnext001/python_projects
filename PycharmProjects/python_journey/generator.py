"""
Generators are special functions in Python that allow you to iterate over data lazily â€” that is,
they generate values one at a time only when needed.
This is more memory-efficient than storing everything in a list.
Generators are written like regular functions but use the **yield** keyword instead of return.

Iterating over large datasets/files
Instead of reading all lines into memory:

def read_lines(filepath):
    with open(filepath) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line
