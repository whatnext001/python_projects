List comprehension is explained below:
List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by performing 
an operation on each item in an existing iterable (like a list, range, or string), in a single line of code.
Like I want 'items' for each items in the 'list'
"""
# Basic_syntax:
# new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
# expression: what you want to do with each item (can be just the item itself or some transformation of it)
#item: a variable that takes each value from the iterable
#iterable: the collection youâ€™re looping through
#condition (optional): a filter to include only certain items
