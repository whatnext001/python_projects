"""
Special methods—also known as magic methods or dunder (double underscore)
methods—are predefined methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (__like_this__).
They allow you to define how your custom objects behave with Python’s built-in operations
like printing, adding, comparing, or accessing attributes.
